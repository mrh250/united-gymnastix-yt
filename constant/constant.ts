        bio: "Mladen’s impressive gymnastics resume begins when he left home at age 8 to become a student-athlete at the National Sports Academy in his native Bulgaria, and culminates at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, where he helped the Bulgarian national team to a 12th place finish. Along the way, he racked up individual medals in many international competitions, including the prestigious European and World Championships. Still, Mladen is just as comfortable teaching seat drops to preschoolers as he is coaching complex technique to our national competitors. Since 2002, boys and girls of all skill levels at our gym have benefitted from his extensive experience and playful instruction, a combination that keeps his students constantly learning… while having great fun.",

She is a Bethany College (WV) graduate, and worked for several years in the toy industry before having four wonderful sons. She has never gone very long without teaching in the gym, and now enjoys coaching United’s Girls' team, facilitating Parent-And-Tot classes, and choreographing floor routines.",
